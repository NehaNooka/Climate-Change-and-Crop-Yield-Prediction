# Climate-Change-and-Crop-Yield-Prediction
Build a model to predict crop yields (e.g., corn, wheat, rice) based on historical climate data and climate change projections. By analyzing the relationship between climate variables and crop yields, the model aims to forecast the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity.
