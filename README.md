# Factors-Impacting-Crop-Yield-Prediction

# Objective: 
Build a model to predict crop yields (e.g., rice,wheat,corn,etc) based on historical climate data and climate change projections. By analyzing the relationship between different  variables and crop yields, the model aims to forecast the impact on agricultural productivity.

# Tasks: 
Data preprocessing (including feature engineering and handling missing values), model selection (e.g., linear regression, random forest, neural networks), and model evaluation.

# Performance Evaluation Metric: 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can be used as performance evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of crop yield predictions. These metrics quantify the average prediction error between actual and predicted crop yields, providing insights into the model's predictive capability.

# Analysis Type: 
Predictive Modeling (Regression)
