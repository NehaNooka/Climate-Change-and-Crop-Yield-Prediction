# Factors-Impacting-Crop-Yield-Prediction

# Objective: 
We aim to explore the various factors that influence crop yields and develop predictive models to forecast future yields based on these factors. One dataset that could be used for this project is from the Food And Agricultural Organizations of the United Nations website, which provides comprehensive information on crop production, crop emissions, temperature, and agricultural practices across different regions and time periods.

The primary objective of this project is to identify the most significant factors affecting crop yields and develop accurate predictive models to forecast future yields. We will evaluate the performance of our models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared value to assess their predictive accuracy and reliability. By understanding the factors influencing crop yields and building predictive models, we can provide valuable insights for farmers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to optimize agricultural practices and improve food security.

# Tasks: 
Data preprocessing (including feature engineering and handling missing values), model selection (e.g., linear regression, random forest, neural networks), and model evaluation.

# Performance Evaluation Metric: 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can be used as performance evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of crop yield predictions. These metrics quantify the average prediction error between actual and predicted crop yields, providing insights into the model's predictive capability.

# Analysis Type: 
Predictive Modeling (Regression)
